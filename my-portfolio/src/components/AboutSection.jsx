      I’m Adewuyi Raihanat, a passionate Frontend Developer dedicated to building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences. With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, I craft visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that enhance user engagement.

<br />My journey into web development was strengthened through the Tech4Dev Fellowship, where I honed my frontend skills, and my internship at Tireda, where I gained hands-on experience in real-world projects. Additionally, my background in IT support at Deostruct Engineering and SMEDAN has equipped me with strong problem-solving abilities, troubleshooting expertise, and a keen eye for detail.

<br />I thrive on learning and improving, always seeking new challenges that push my creativity and technical skills. Whether it’s optimizing performance, improving accessibility, or creating seamless user experiences, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions.

I’m excited to collaborate, innovate, and contribute to projects that make a difference. Let’s build something amazing together!
